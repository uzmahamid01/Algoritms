if we have an empty matrix:
zero_matrix = [[0 for _ in range (len(matrix[0]))] for _ in range(len(matrix))] 
zero_matrix = [[0 * (len(matrix[0]))] for _ in range(len(matrix))] 

copy the above matrix 
copied_matrix = [row[:] for row in matrix]


matrix ds is used when we want to store data in the form of table or grid.
array of arrays where array at each index has the same size.
x[i][j]



Applications:
- linear algebra
- statistics
- optimization
- signal processing such as filtering and transformation
- Network Analsisi: such as finding the shortest path between two nodes or two networks
- Quantum Mechanics: to represent states and operations


Declaration of the matrix:
numRows = 3
numCols = 3

arr = [[0] * numCols]*numRows
print(arr)
